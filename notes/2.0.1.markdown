This is mainly a maintenance release bringing these improvements:

- Fixed ScalaReflectionException under Scala 2.11 when scala-reflect is not on the classpath (#81)
- Increased operator argument limit from 9 to 22 (#85)
- Added `named` rule modifier and `namedRule` helper for explicit naming of inner rules (#50)
- Smaller project-internal cleanup

Additionally I have added a new documentation chapter on “Meta-Rules” [here](https://github.com/sirthias/parboiled2#advanced-techniques),
a topic which appears to become a frequently asked question on the parboiled2 mailing list.
