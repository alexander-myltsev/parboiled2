This is the final release of parboiled 2.0.

parboiled 2 improves upon parboiled 1.x in many ways, most importantly parsing performance and DSL flexibility.
The final adds only one small patch to the preceding RC2 and fixes an issue causing stack overflows in certain situations involving large input.
